# Owner questions

## oq5: fw3 rule refinements, orchestrator default (2026-10-31, owner delegated)
- A pinned (At) hero whose footprint reaches a road corridor is pushed outward 4 studs per try (max 24) instead of
  warning; measured pushes 4-8 studs (Landmark_259, _263, _315, _49).
- A padded prop (house) whose footprint reaches a corridor sits at the corridor's lowest ground under it (CorridorLow)
  so it never floats; pads never overlap (9 Docks houses removed by that rule).
- Chosen as the recommended fix (houses gap 0, TileRing gap 0, 0 warnings in the Lune harness). Spec 3.2 Pad details.
  Review in the morning; revert = commit on orch/biomes/fw3.

## Morning review list (overnight run, 2026-10-31)
- Track camera: session-only setting (TrackCamera attribute), not saved across sessions, like the other toggles.
- fw4 (orchestrator default): halls in narrow gaps sit at road level (Track 4: 22 of 35) instead of being dropped; 7 fewer padded props kept overall.
- Track 6: billboards show abstract shapes, not made-up text (spec 7 wording; avoids the generator writing real words).
  ToppledRobot hero ~31 x 25 x 31 placed (under the placeholder 60-220 hero height; the mesh generator caps short sides
  at ~16 studs). AcademyTower stretched 2.6x vertically to ~200 placed.
- NPC rival names (spec: label RIVAL over <Name>) are not implemented in code: NpcConfig has no Name field (label shows track08_NPC). Enelu [Enel] is in the spec only; implementing rival names/models is a separate task (not in biome scope).
- Track 7: heroes sized to fit under the 20-40 stud tunnel ceilings (~23-33 tall), below the placeholder 60-220 hero height; the stalled train stands on a bay platform (framework builds bays as platforms).
- fw6: on tunnel tracks a pinned hero that cannot fit in its bay is not built (warns) - the 'never deleted' rule cannot place it in the earth.
- Track 7: plain tunnel stretches between bays carry no dressing props (Prune keeps props 8 studs from the road, leaving <1 stud to the wall); only tiles, stripe and light strips. Kept as is (orchestrator default).
- Track 8: GiantBeanstalk and CloudTown heroes are part-built (generator caps ~2:1; CloudTown try read as a face). Bell toll is ProSoundEffects 9113804175 (Studio cannot upload audio). 0.82-1.0 Inner is now cloud mounds so the bell is visible.
- Track 4: MoonPeak horizon backdrop reads as a flat pale box (T4_Landmark). Track 10: hard near/far water edge in the aerial; dome-house doors face away from the road.

## 2026-11-03 uipolish: active runner animation (rules audit)
Design doc 4.20 says every animation goes through `Client/UiMotion`. The team row's active glow and marker bob are a RenderStepped loop in `TeamHud.client.luau`, not a UiMotion preset; they do stop under reduced motion, and `CheckpointUi` uses the same pattern. Question: does that gate satisfy 4.20, or must the loop move into UiMotion? Blocks nothing.
- Track 5: BrokenStorefront has a weak face reading (see T5_Storefront.jpg). SlicedTower top floats above the cut; viaduct deck stays level.
- 2026-10-31: the Track 8 builder killed and restarted the IVS dashboard (`server.py --port 8765`). Check it runs with your usual flags.
- Max Players: Edit-mode Players.MaxPlayers still read 60 (`WorkshopConfig` needs 7); check in a live server.

## 2026-11-03 trim: doc and code disagree (left as written, owner to rule)
- `MAX_CRUISE_TOTAL_MULTI`, `CruiseStatMulti`: design doc 4.5, 4.8, TEAM_AND_STAMINA_SPEC and CHARACTER_GACHA_SPEC cite them; `MAX_CRUISE_TOTAL_MULTI` is not in `src/`, `CruiseStatMulti` only in tests as retired (`Scenarios.luau:2876,2911`).
- Rock colour: TRACKS References Track 1 says #9C8F7E, BIOME 3.4 and `TerrainBuilder` say #8A6E52; both tagged owner 2026-10-31.
- Track 7 heroes: BIOME 7 lists three; `Desert.luau:115` also builds a collapsed escalator.
- Design doc 3 loops back to Track 1; 4.15 and `RaceService` loop to the checkpoint.
- Design doc 7 save list says VERSION 1 and `Speed`; code has VERSION 13, no `Speed`, plus `RebirthLevel`.
- Design doc 4.13 lists the Money branch under speed multi. Design doc 4.4 omits the c3 exhaustion ruling (it is in the change log and spec).
- Design doc 4.7 Stamina potion x1.5, 15 min; code has tiers StaminaI-III.
- TRACKS "never change global Lighting" (tests cite it) vs client-local Lighting in BIOME 1 and design doc 4.10. TRACKS "stat speed" wording vs the retired Speed stat (4.13).
- CHARACTER_GACHA_SPEC `SpeedMulti` row and TEAM_AND_STAMINA_SPEC `CruiseStatMulti` vs the retired Speed stat (design doc 4.13). CHARACTER_GACHA_SPEC "33 rollable" vs event-only characters not rollable.
- WORLD_REDESIGN_SPEC leaderboard text vs design doc 4.16. NPC_RIVAL_SPEC "start track" vs design doc 4.15.
- WORLD_REDESIGN_SPEC scrap list names `CarFactory`, `CarConfig`, `rusty_hatchback`; they are still in `src/` or `tools/`.

## 2026-11-03 trim: proposed rule
Add to CLAUDE.md: `handoff.md` holds current state only; replace stale lines, never append history. It grew to 53 KB by appending.

## 2026-11-04 ui-juice: flow rulings from the UI audit (docs/UI_AUDIT.md); nothing is blocked
- A1 Rebirth: one tap wipes the player's money with no confirm. Add a second step? Motion pass adds the celebration either way.
- A3 Emphasized roll closes Index, Stats, Settings and Rebirth mid-use (seen once, inferred from code). Hold the emphasized view until the panel closes, or use the compact roll?
- A19 Auto turns off with no message when the team is exhausted (`RaceService.luau:632`), so an idle game needs a tap per run. Intended? If yes, the exhausted toast gains "Auto stopped".
- `docs/HUD_LAYOUT_SPEC.md` is cited by code and harness but is absent from the repo. Panel open scale: 4.20 says 0.9, `UiSpec.luau:1261` says 0.92.
- Sounds: Coin and Denied are community uploads with unknown origin, not ProSoundEffects; listen and swap if needed.
- 2026-11-04: to review: panels close on outside click (Duel excluded), Upgrades has no EXIT and hides the HUD buttons while open, Quests has a claimable badge (design doc 4.33).
- 2026-11-04: Index Equip on Team slots 2 and 3 stays active per design doc 4.2 (single equip moves to slot 1, the server swaps), although audit A14 suggested "IN TEAM" on all 3. Only slot 1 is disabled.

## 2026-11-04 ui-juice u5: rulings from the rules audit; nothing is blocked
- RULED 2026-11-04 (owner): Burst may play over the moment's own panel; UI_FEEDBACK_SPEC 3 amended. Was: Burst over open panels: Daily, Quest and Rebirth claim inside their own open panel. `docs/UI_AUDIT.md` rows pair them with Burst; UI_FEEDBACK_SPEC 3 bans Burst over open panels. Kept as the audit table says until ruled. A running roll now always skips Burst.
- One Sound per cue (UI_FEEDBACK_SPEC 2) against RollSecret's Boom + Chime (`docs/UI_AUDIT.md`). Kept both. Chime now plays at 4.5 (spec x5), Boom at 0.9.
- Audit fixes not listed in design doc 4.33, each changing pins or behaviour: Backpack opens on Characters (`UiContracts.luau:841`), race map moved (`UiResponsive.luau:84`), track name changed (A17), "NEXT REBIRTH" label (A25), grey BUY (A18). Add them to 4.33?
- Coin and Denied are community uploads of unknown origin and no sound has been heard, so design doc 5's "no anime IP" rests on asset details only.
- `ui_run_visual` `mesh_loaded`: a mesh whose fetch ends up to 5 s after the drawn copy first appears passes. A real player sees that model pop in on its first run; no preload of worn models exists. Accept, or preload the Team's models?
